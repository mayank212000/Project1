                    Bhagat Singh (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab,
                     India [now in Pakistan]—died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]) revolutionary 
                     hero of the Indian independence movement.

                     Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School,
                      which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then National College, 
                     both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked as a writer and editor in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories. He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”).
                
                     In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death
                     of Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College,
                     during a silent march opposing the Simon Commission. <br><br><br> Instead, in a case of mistaken 
                     identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to 
                     escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central 
                     Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act
                      and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.
